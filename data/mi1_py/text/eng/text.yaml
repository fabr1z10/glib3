    1: "Ahoy there, stranger."
    2: "New in town?"
    3: "My name's Guybrush Threepwood. I'm new in town."
    4: "Are you a pirate? Can I be on your crew?"
    5: "Who's in charge here?"
    6: "Nice talking to you."
    7: "Have fun on Mêlée Island�."
    8: "Hey, nice to see you again."
    9: "Guybrush Threepwood?"
    10: "Ha ha ha!!!"
    11: "That's the stupidest name I've ever heard!"
    12: "I don't know... I kind of like 'Guybrush'."
    13: "Well, what's YOUR name?"
    14: "Yeah, it's pretty dumb, isn't it?"
    15: "I'm insulted. Goodbye."
    16: "But it's not even a name!"
    17: "My name is Mancomb Seepgood."
    18: "So what brings you to Mêlée Island� anyway?"
    19: "I want to be a pirate!"
    20: "I've come seeking my fortune."
    21: "I really don't know."
    22: "None of your business. Goodbye."
    23: "Oh really?"
    24: "You should go talk to the important-looking pirates in the next room."
    25: "They're pretty much in charge around here."
    26: "They can tell you where to go and what to do."
    27: "Where can I find the Governor?"
    28: "Oh, you Have, have you?"
    29: "Well, I am a pirate."
    30: "But, alas, I'm not a captain."
    31: "Governor Marley?"
    32: "Her mansion is on the other side of town."
    33: "But pirates aren't as welcome around her place as they used to be."
    34: "Why not?"
    35: "I'm welcome everywhere I go."
    36: "I think I'll go there right now. Bye."
    37: "Okay, but watch out for those guard dogs!"
    38: "My grog is going flat, so you'll have to excuse me."
    39: "I don't want to come between a pirate and his grog."
    40: "Well, this island has a governor..."
    41: "...but we pirates have our own leaders."
    42: "I want to talk to the leaders of the pirates."
    43: "Where can I find the Governor of the island?"

    45: "That's okay."
    46: "Mine is Mancomb Seepgood."
    47: "Sorry to see you go away mad."
    48: "Don't be a stranger."
    49: "So, what was your name, anyway?"
    50: "Well, it sure wasn't for the sunshine."
    51: "I think you need some guidance."
    52: "Well, the last time she had a pirate over for dinner, he fell in love with her."
    53: "It's made things rather uncomfortable for everybody."
    54: "How's that?"
    55: "Who is this pirate?"
    56: "That's too bad. Well, see you later."
    57: "Well, excuse me Mr. Secretive."
    58: "It was none other than the fearsome pirate LeChuck."
    59: "Well, there's a whole big story about what happened next..."
    60: "But I don't believe a word of it."
    61: "Estevan over there at the other table might tell you about it."
    62: "He takes the whole thing seriously."
    63: "Very seriously."
    64: "Whatever you say."
    65: "Just watch out for those guard dogs!"

    6: "Never mind."
    7: "Good night."
    8: "Excuse me, but do--"

    10: "I just want a map."
    11: "My cousin Sven sends his regards."
    12: "Could you tell me that code again?"
    13: "Never mind. I can get a map somewhere else."
    14: "Wanna bet?"
    15: "Now get lost."
    16: "Of course it's a code, you idiot."
    17: "Close enough."
    18: "Let's talk business."
    19: "You want to buy a map to the Legendary Lost Treasure of Mêlée Island�?"
    20: "Only one in existence."
    21: "Rare."
    22: "Very rare."
    23: "Only 100 pieces of eight..."
    24: "No thanks. I don't have enough money."
    25: "No thanks. I don't want it."
    26: "Well then, buzz off kid, it's bad for business."
    27: "Come back for the map to the Legendary Lost Treasure of Mêlée Island�, eh?"

    36: "I'll take it. It'll make a swell gift."
    37: "There ya go. You've made a wise decision."
    38: "Now get lost."
  lookout: 
    1: "I heard there was going to be a weenie roast here."
    2: "I'm looking for fun. Seen any?"
    3: "What's green and hairy and has a thousand legs?"
    4: "Do you ever wonder if we're all just characters in a novel?"
    5: "Yikes!"
    6: "You almost scared me to death."
    7: "I thought you were a--"
    8: "--never mind."
    9: "What did you say your name was, again?"
    10: "I'm Guybrush Threepwood."
    11: "Call me Squinky."
    12: "I'm over this way."
    13: "Who are YOU?"
    14: "I'll just be off to seek my fortune now."
    15: "Eh?"
    16: "Oh."
    17: "I came to Mêlée Island because I want to be a pirate."
    18: "Well, you picked the right place for it."
    19: "Though perhaps the wrong time."
    20: "Not to mention the wrong name."
    21: "You have the silliest name I've heard in a long time."
    22: "What the heck is wrong with \"Guybrush Threepwood\"?"
    23: "Nothing, if you want to sell shoes."
    24: "You want to be a pirate, boy, take my advice:"
    25: "Change your name."
    26: "Try something like \"Dreadbeard\" or \"Six-fingered Pete\"."
    27: "You just said you were Gibberish Driftwood, or something like that."
    28: "GUYBRUSH THREEPwood."
    29: "Sure, whatever."
    30: "I'm the lookout of Mêlée Island."
    31: "I watch the ocean for approaching storms and ships, and report them directly to the Governor."
    32: "She doesn't like unexpected visitors."
    33: "...especially not now."
    34: "Why is the Governor worried about unexpected visitors?"
    35: "Actually, it's the EXPECTED visitors we're worried about."
    36: "One pirate captain in particular..."
    37: "A dead one, but that doesn't make him any less dangerous."
    38: "How did you get to be the lookout when you're obviously blind as a bat?"
    39: "Watch your tongue."
    40: "I was hand-picked by Sheriff Shinetop!"
    41: "OK, Squinky."
    42: "Good luck."
    43: "Oh, it's you again, "
    44: "Listen, I'm sort of busy right now."
    45: "I'll talk to you later."
    46: "Look out! Ha ha. Get it?"
    47: "That's THREEPWOOD."
    48: "Actually, my name is Guybrush Threepwood."
    49: "Oh, right."
    50: "I am not sure, but I think he may be *asleep."
    51: "It's the only one I've ever heard that was more ridiculous than \"Squinky\"."
    52: "I'm over here."
    53: "Thranwook."
    54: "Thrumwink."
