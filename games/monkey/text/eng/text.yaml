    8: "Hey, nice to see you again."

    ilikeguy: "I don't know... I kind of like 'Guybrush'."
    yourname: "Well, what's YOUR name?"
    dumb: "Yeah, it's pretty dumb, isn't it?"
    insulted: "I'm insulted. Goodbye."
    16: "But it's not even a name!"
    17: "My name is Mancomb Seepgood."
    18: "So what brings you to Mêlée Island™ anyway?"
    19: "I want to be a pirate!"
    20: "I've come seeking my fortune."
    21: "I really don't know."
    22: "None of your business. Goodbye."
    23: "Oh really?"
    24: "You should go talk to the important-looking pirates in the next room."
    25: "They're pretty much in charge around here."
    26: "They can tell you where to go and what to do."
    guvnor: "Where can I find the Governor?"
    28: "Oh, you Have, have you?"
    29: "Well, I am a pirate."
    30: "But, alas, I'm not a captain."
    31: "Governor Marley?"
    32: "Her mansion is on the other side of town."
    33: "But pirates aren't as welcome around her place as they used to be."
    whynot: "Why not?"
    welcome: "I'm welcome everywhere I go."
    gothere: "I think I'll go there right now. Bye."
    37: "Okay, but watch out for those guard dogs!"
    38: "My grog is going flat, so you'll have to excuse me."
    39: "I don't want to come between a pirate and his grog."
    40: "Well, this island has a governor..."
    41: "...but we pirates have our own leaders."
    leaders: "I want to talk to the leaders of the pirates."

    48: "Don't be a stranger."
    yourname2: "So, what was your name, anyway?"
    50: "Well, it sure wasn't for the sunshine."
    51: "I think you need some guidance."
    52: "Well, the last time she had a pirate over for dinner, he fell in love with her."
    53: "It's made things rather uncomfortable for everybody."
    howsthat: "How's that?"
    whois: "Who is this pirate?"
    toobad: "That's too bad. Well, see you later."
    57: "Well, excuse me Mr. Secretive."
    58: "It was none other than the fearsome pirate LeChuck."
    59: "Well, there's a whole big story about what happened next..."
    60: "But I don't believe a word of it."
    61: "Estevan over there at the other table might tell you about it."
    62: "He takes the whole thing seriously."
    63: "Very seriously."
    64: "Whatever you say."
    65: "Just watch out for those guard dogs!"

    1: "Excuse me, but do you have a cousin named Sven?"
    2: "What?"
    3: "No, I don't."
    4: "What is that? Some sort of code?"
    5: "No, but I once had a barber named Dominique."
    6: "Never mind."
    7: "Good night."
    8: "Excuse me, but do--"
    9: "Oh, it's only you again."
    10: "I just want a map."
    11: "My cousin Sven sends his regards."
    12: "Could you tell me that code again?"
    13: "Never mind. I can get a map somewhere else."
    14: "Wanna bet?"
    15: "Now get lost."
    16: "Of course it's a code, you idiot."
    17: "Close enough."
    18: "Let's talk business."
    19: "You want to buy a map to the Legendary Lost Treasure of Mêlée Island�?"
    20: "Only one in existence."
    21: "Rare."
    22: "Very rare."
    23: "Only 100 pieces of eight..."
    24: "No thanks. I don't have enough money."
    25: "No thanks. I don't want it."
    26: "Well then, buzz off kid, it's bad for business."
    27: "Come back for the map to the Legendary Lost Treasure of Mêlée Island�, eh?"
    28: "I hope you brought enough money this time."
    29: "Shhhhhhh!"
    30: "Pipe down, will ya?"

    32: "Now, then..."
    33: "I see."
    34: "Not enough money, eh?"
    35: "Come back when you're serious about treasure hunting, kid."
    36: "I'll take it. It'll make a swell gift."
    37: "There ya go. You've made a wise decision."
    38: "Now get lost."
  lowmoral:
    1: "Hey, nice rat!"
    2: "How can you stand to be near this vermin?"
    3: "Do you guys know the sneaky-looking man on the opposite corner?"
    4: "Say, are you guys pirates?"
    5: "I'll just be running along, now."
    6: "Do you like rats?"
    7: "Yes, I love rats!"
    8: "No, I can't stand them."
    9: "Yes, especially in a light wine sauce."
    10: "I can't talk about it right now. Got to go."
    11: "They're very intelligent creatures!"
    12: "Ha ha ha ha!!"
    13: "More intelligent than HIM!"
    14: "Why, there's a story around these parts that a bunch of rats actually crewed a ship here from fabled Monkey Island�."
    15: "No, that's not right."
    16: "It was actually a group of monkeys."
    17: "That's amazing!"
    18: "That's difficult to believe."
    19: "No way could a bunch of stupid monkeys crew a ship!"
    20: "Excuse me, I must be going."
    21: "But true."
    22: "When they arrived, they sold the ship for a pretty penny."
    23: "Only time I've seen anyone get the better of ol'Stan in a deal."
    24: "I thought it was rats..."
    25: "Wanna buy a map, eh?"
    26: "OUR maps are top quality, not like the birdcage liners you get from that clown across the street."
    27: "No, just kidding."
    28: "These are actually copies of the minutes of the last meeting of the M�l�e Island� PTA."
    29: "Can't even GIVE them away."
    30: "Want one?"
    31: "No, thanks."
    32: "No, I must be on my way."
    33: "No, but I'll take one if you give me two pieces of eight."
    34: "Oh, they are not so bad."
    35: "-- squeak --"
    36: "Sounds like this guy don't like rats!"
    37: "Let's sauté him now!"
    38: "I think you'd best leave, boy."
    39: "Ha ha ha ha ha hoo hoo ha ha ha"
    40: "I apologize for what I said about rats."
    41: "But it's true."
    42: "OK, that's fair."
    43: "No, we're a wandering circus troupe."
    44: "But this rat scared away the elephant."
    45: "Of course we're pirates!"
    46: "You can't buy clothes like these off the rack!"
    47: "What do you want?"
    48: "What's in the keg?"
    49: "Where'd you get that rat?"
    50: "Nothing. See you later."
    51: "How come you're on this street corner and not on a ship, looting, pillaging, sacking, that sort of thing?"
    52: "Rum."
    53: "Jam."
    54: "Er... rum and jam."
    55: "It's an old pirate favorite, everybody knows that."
    56: "Actually, they were chimps, and they WEREN'T stupid."
    57: "AIEEE!!! Get away!!!"
    58: "Well, pirating hasn't been panning out so well for us..."
    59: "There are some UNNATURALLY talented pirates in the area right now..."
    60: "...operating out of Monkey Island�."
    61: "So we've been pursuing alternate means of self-support."
    62: "We're trying to start up a circus."
    63: "It was working out well, until the rat scared off the elephant."
    64: "Now you've depressed us."
    65: "Go home."
    66: "See? Told you so."
    67: "I'll take those minutes if you give me two pieces of eight."
    68: "Do you know where I can find a treasure map around here?"
  lookout: 
    intro1: "I heard there was going to be a weenie roast here."
    intro2: "I'm looking for fun. Seen any?"
    intro3: "What's green and hairy and has a thousand legs?"
    intro4: "Do you ever wonder if we're all just characters in a novel?"
    5: "Yikes!"
    6: "You almost scared me to death."
    7: "I thought you were a--"
    8: "--never mind."
    9: "What did you say your name was, again?"
    imguy: "I'm Guybrush Threepwood."
    squinky: "Call me Squinky."
    overthisway: "I'm over this way."
    whoru: "Who are YOU?"
    fortune: "I'll just be off to seek my fortune now."
    15: "Eh?"
    16: "Oh."
    17: "I came to Mêlée Island because I want to be a pirate."
    18: "Well, you picked the right place for it."
    19: "Though perhaps the wrong time."
    20: "Not to mention the wrong name."
    21: "You have the silliest name I've heard in a long time."
    22: "What the heck is wrong with \"Guybrush Threepwood\"?"
    23: "Nothing, if you want to sell shoes."
    24: "You want to be a pirate, boy, take my advice:"
    25: "Change your name."
    26: "Try something like \"Dreadbeard\" or \"Six-fingered Pete\"."
    27: "You just said you were Gibberish Driftwood, or something like that."
    28: "GUYBRUSH THREEPwood."
    29: "Sure, whatever."
    30: "I'm the lookout of Mêlée Island."
    31: "I watch the ocean for approaching storms and ships, and report them directly to the Governor."
    32: "She doesn't like unexpected visitors."
    33: "...especially not now."
    whyguvworried: "Why is the Governor worried about unexpected visitors?"
    35: "Actually, it's the EXPECTED visitors we're worried about."
    36: "One pirate captain in particular..."
    37: "A dead one, but that doesn't make him any less dangerous."
    bat: "How did you get to be the lookout when you're obviously blind as a bat?"
    39: "Watch your tongue."
    40: "I was hand-picked by Sheriff Shinetop!"
    41: "OK, Squinky."
    42: "Good luck."
    43: "Oh, it's you again, "
    44: "Listen, I'm sort of busy right now."
    45: "I'll talk to you later."
    46: "Look out! Ha ha. Get it?"
    47: "That's THREEPWOOD."
    actuallyimguy: "Actually, my name is Guybrush Threepwood."
    49: "Oh, right."
    50: "I am not sure, but I think he may be asleep."
    51: "It's the only one I've ever heard that was more ridiculous than \"Squinky\"."
    overhere: "I'm over here."
    53: "Thranwook."
    54: "Thrumwink."

    3: I want to be a pirate.
    4: I want to be a fireman.
    5: Get lost, boy, you bother us.
    6: So what?
    7: Why bother us?
    8: Hey, don't forget we're short on help because of this whole LeChuck thing.
    9: So?
    10: So, no pirates means no swag, and no swag means no grog, and we're getting dangerously low on grog...
    11: Hmm...
    12: Do you have any special skills?
    13: I can hold my breath for ten minutes!
    14: Well...
    15: All right, but you don't become a pirate just by ASKING.
    16: You'll have to go through...
    17: The three trials!
    18: Er...
    19: What three trials are those?
    20: There are three trials every pirate must pass.
    21: You must master the sword
    22: ...and the art of thievery...
    23: ...and the quest.
    24: The what?
    25: Treasure huntin', ya sea urchin!
    26: Right.
    27: "You must prove yourself in each of these three areas:"
    28: swordplay, thievery, and, er, treasure huntery;
    29: then return with proof that you've done it.
    30: And then ye must drink grog with us!!
    31: GROG!!!
    32: "Tell me more about mastering the sword."
    33: "Tell me more about mastering the art of thievery."
    34: "Tell me more about treasure hunting."
    35: "You're a bunch of foul-smelling, grog-swilling pigs!"
    36: "What's in that grog stuff, anyway?"
    37: "I'll just be running along now."
    38: "Leave us to our grog."
    39: "Come back later and tell us how ye're doing."
    40: "Well, if it isn't the boy who wants to be a pirate."
    41: "How do you fare on your quests?"
    42: "First, get ye a sword."
    43: "You must seek out and defeat the Sword Master."
    44: "Someone in town can probably direct you."
    45: "Oh!"
    46: "You'll want to find someone to train you first."
    47: "Ha ha."
    48: "Imagine trying to take on the Sword Master without any training!"
    49: "Har har har"
    50: "Tell me again about mastering the sword."
    51: "And get yourself trained first."
    52: "We want you to procure a small item for us..."
    53: "The Idol of Many Hands..."
    54: "...in the Governor's mansion!"
    55: "The Governor keeps the Idol o' Many Hands in a display case in the mansion outside of town."
    56: "You'll have to get past the guards, naturally."
    57: "The tricky part will be getting past the dogs outside."
    58: "They're a particularly vicious breed..."
    59: "...you might be able to drug them or something."
    60: "Tell me again about pilfering the idol."
    61: "Legend has it that there's a treasure buried here on the island..."
    62: "All you must do is find the Legendary Lost Treasure of Mêlée Island™ and bring it back here."
    63: "Should I have a map or something?"
    64: "You can hardly expect to find a treasure without a map!"
    65: "...and don't forget:"
    66: "X marks the spot!"
    67: "Tell me again about the Lost Treasure."
    68: "To be a pirate ye must also be a foul-smelling, grog-swilling pig."
    69: "Grog is a secret mixture which contains one or more of the following:"
    70: "kerosene"
    71: "propylene glycol"
    72: "artificial sweeteners"
    73: "sulphuric acid"

    77: "scumm"
    78: "axle grease"
    79: "battery acid"
    80: "and/or pepperoni"
    81: "As you can probably imagine, it's one of the most caustic, volatile substances known to man."
    82: "The stuff eats right through these mugs and the cook is losing a fortune replacing them."
lines:
  1: "Re-elect Governor Marley."
  2: "\"When there's only one candidate, there's only one choice.\""
  3: "Cozy."
  4: "I don't want to bother them."
  5: "They're busy listening to the guy on the left."
  6: "I don't think it's wise to wake a sleeping pirate."
  7: "Actually, I'm not THAT curious to find out what's inside."
  8: "Probably poisonous snakes."
  9: "No thanks, I'd rather not touch any of this creepy voodoo stuff."
  10: "Gee, I wonder what's in these baskets."
  11: "Hmmm... I think I hear slithering inside."
  12: "No thanks. Something would probably jump out and bite me."
  13: "Poor chickens..."
  14: "I'd better not. They're probably being saved for a pagan ritual, and I wouldn't want to spoil it."

  20: "Cat knuckles?!?"
  21: "How barbaric!"
  22: "No thanks. I can never fall asleep in strange places."
  23: "Looks comfortable, in a spooky sort of way."
  24: "Probably got a body in it."
  25: "Hmmm..."
  26: "A rubber chicken with a pulley in the middle..."
  27: "What possible use could that have?"
  28: "Maybe no one will miss just this one thing..."
  29: "Poor little thing..."
  30: "Whatever it was."
  31: "Now, THIS is the cup of a carpenter."
  32: Hey!
  33: Don't go into the kitchen!
  34: You can't come back here!
  35: It's some sort of meat or meatlike substance...
  36: Someone cooked a headcheese in this.
  37: I think it's a herring.
  38: I think that bird will peck my hand off...
  39: I think it's full of that foul stuff pirates drink.
  40: It's boiling hot.
  41: Hmm. Stewed meat.
  42: Ouch!
  43: Got it!
