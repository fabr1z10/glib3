    11: Right.
    12: A drink?
    13: You could wait for the cook to notice you...
    14: ...but that could take all day.
    15: Just find a mug and sneak into the kitchen.
    16: That's what we all do.
    17: What happened to your eye?
    18: Well, I was putting in my contact lens when--

    16: "Of course it's a code, you idiot."
    17: "Close enough."

    19: "You want to buy a map to the Legendary Lost Treasure of Mêlée Island�?"
    20: "Only one in existence."
    21: "Rare."
    22: "Very rare."
    23: "Only 100 pieces of eight..."
    24: "No thanks. I don't have enough money."
    25: "No thanks. I don't want it."
    26: "Well then, buzz off kid, it's bad for business."

    5: "I'll just be running along, now."
    6: "Do you like rats?"
    7: "Yes, I love rats!"
    8: "No, I can't stand them."
    9: "Yes, especially in a light wine sauce."
    10: "I can't talk about it right now. Got to go."
    11: "They're very intelligent creatures!"
    12: "Ha ha ha ha!!"
    13: "More intelligent than HIM!"
    14: "Why, there's a story around these parts that a bunch of rats actually crewed a ship here from fabled Monkey Island�."
    15: "No, that's not right."
    16: "It was actually a group of monkeys."
    17: "That's amazing!"
    18: "That's difficult to believe."
    19: "No way could a bunch of stupid monkeys crew a ship!"
    20: "Excuse me, I must be going."
    21: "But true."
    22: "When they arrived, they sold the ship for a pretty penny."
    23: "Only time I've seen anyone get the better of ol'Stan in a deal."
    24: "I thought it was rats..."
    25: "Wanna buy a map, eh?"
    26: "OUR maps are top quality, not like the birdcage liners you get from that clown across the street."
    27: "No, just kidding."
    28: "These are actually copies of the minutes of the last meeting of the M�l�e Island� PTA."
    29: "Can't even GIVE them away."
    30: "Want one?"
    31: "No, thanks."
    32: "No, I must be on my way."
    33: "No, but I'll take one if you give me two pieces of eight."
    34: "Oh, they are not so bad."
    35: "-- squeak --"
    36: "Sounds like this guy don't like rats!"
    37: "Let's sauté him now!"
    38: "I think you'd best leave, boy."
    39: "Ha ha ha ha ha hoo hoo ha ha ha"
    40: "I apologize for what I said about rats."
    41: "But it's true."
    42: "OK, that's fair."
    43: "No, we're a wandering circus troupe."
    44: "But this rat scared away the elephant."
    45: "Of course we're pirates!"
    46: "You can't buy clothes like these off the rack!"
    47: "What do you want?"
    48: "What's in the keg?"
    49: "Where'd you get that rat?"
    50: "Nothing. See you later."
    51: "How come you're on this street corner and not on a ship, looting, pillaging, sacking, that sort of thing?"
    52: "Rum."
    53: "Jam."
    54: "Er... rum and jam."
    55: "It's an old pirate favorite, everybody knows that."
    56: "Actually, they were chimps, and they WEREN'T stupid."
    57: "AIEEE!!! Get away!!!"
    58: "Well, pirating hasn't been panning out so well for us..."
    59: "There are some UNNATURALLY talented pirates in the area right now..."
    60: "...operating out of Monkey Island�."
    61: "So we've been pursuing alternate means of self-support."
    62: "We're trying to start up a circus."
    63: "It was working out well, until the rat scared off the elephant."
    64: "Now you've depressed us."
    65: "Go home."
    66: "See? Told you so."
    67: "I'll take those minutes if you give me two pieces of eight."
    68: "Do you know where I can find a treasure map around here?"
  lookout: 
    intro1: "I heard there was going to be a weenie roast here."
    intro2: "I'm looking for fun. Seen any?"
    intro3: "What's green and hairy and has a thousand legs?"
    intro4: "Do you ever wonder if we're all just characters in a novel?"
    5: "Yikes!"
    6: "You almost scared me to death."

    18: "Well, you picked the right place for it."
    19: "Though perhaps the wrong time."
    20: "Not to mention the wrong name."
    21: "You have the silliest name I've heard in a long time."
    22: "What the heck is wrong with \"Guybrush Threepwood\"?"
    23: "Nothing, if you want to sell shoes."
    24: "You want to be a pirate, boy, take my advice:"
    25: "Change your name."
    26: "Try something like \"Dreadbeard\" or \"Six-fingered Pete\"."
    27: "You just said you were Gibberish Driftwood, or something like that."
    28: "GUYBRUSH THREEPwood."
    29: "Sure, whatever."
    30: "I'm the lookout of Mêlée Island."
    31: "I watch the ocean for approaching storms and ships, and report them directly to the Governor."
    32: "She doesn't like unexpected visitors."
    33: "...especially not now."
    whyguvworried: "Why is the Governor worried about unexpected visitors?"
    35: "Actually, it's the EXPECTED visitors we're worried about."
    36: "One pirate captain in particular..."
    37: "A dead one, but that doesn't make him any less dangerous."
    bat: "How did you get to be the lookout when you're obviously blind as a bat?"
    39: "Watch your tongue."
    40: "I was hand-picked by Sheriff Shinetop!"
    41: "OK, Squinky."
    42: "Good luck."
    43: "Oh, it's you again, "
    44: "Listen, I'm sort of busy right now."
    45: "I'll talk to you later."
    46: "Look out! Ha ha. Get it?"

    actuallyimguy: "Actually, my name is Guybrush Threepwood."
    49: "Oh, right."
    50: "I am not sure, but I think he may be asleep."
    51: "It's the only one I've ever heard that was more ridiculous than \"Squinky\"."

    2: "Well, I can't do it, I hurt my hand taming the lions last week."

    56: "--Is get in the cannon--"
    57: "--And we'll shoot you out of it--"
    58: "--Across the room--"
    59: "--Quite safe, actually--"
    60: "--So, what do you say?"
    61: "OK, I'll do it."
    62: "How much will you give me?"
    63: "Forget it!"
    64: "How about 478 pieces of eight?"
    65: "OK, sounds good."

    74: "Oh, you've got to have a helmet--"
    75: "--Can't do the cannon trick without a helmet--"
    76: "--Nosiree!"
    77: "Go get a helmet, and then we can do the trick."
    78: "Well, let's have it."
    79: "We want to be sure--"
    80: "--That is's safe--"
    81: "--Wouldn't want you hurt--"
    82: "Ah, that will work as a helmet!"
    83: "Now we can do the trick."
    84: "Step right over here, son."

    4: I want to be a fireman.
    5: Get lost, boy, you bother us.
    6: So what?
    7: Why bother us?
    8: Hey, don't forget we're short on help because of this whole LeChuck thing.
    9: So?
    10: So, no pirates means no swag, and no swag means no grog, and we're getting dangerously low on grog...
    11: Hmm...
    12: Do you have any special skills?
    13: I can hold my breath for ten minutes!
    14: Well...
    15: All right, but you don't become a pirate just by ASKING.
    16: You'll have to go through...
    17: The three trials!
    18: Er...
    19: What three trials are those?
    20: There are three trials every pirate must pass.
    21: You must master the sword
    22: ...and the art of thievery...
    23: ...and the quest.
    24: The what?
    25: Treasure huntin', ya sea urchin!
    26: Right.
    27: "You must prove yourself in each of these three areas:"
    28: swordplay, thievery, and, er, treasure huntery;
    29: then return with proof that you've done it.
    30: And then ye must drink grog with us!!
    31: GROG!!!
    32: "Tell me more about mastering the sword."
    33: "Tell me more about mastering the art of thievery."
    34: "Tell me more about treasure hunting."
    35: "You're a bunch of foul-smelling, grog-swilling pigs!"
    36: "What's in that grog stuff, anyway?"
    37: "I'll just be running along now."
    38: "Leave us to our grog."
    39: "Come back later and tell us how ye're doing."
    40: "Well, if it isn't the boy who wants to be a pirate."
    41: "How do you fare on your quests?"
    42: "First, get ye a sword."
    43: "You must seek out and defeat the Sword Master."
    44: "Someone in town can probably direct you."
    45: "Oh!"
    46: "You'll want to find someone to train you first."
    47: "Ha ha."
    48: "Imagine trying to take on the Sword Master without any training!"
    49: "Har har har"
    50: "Tell me again about mastering the sword."
    51: "And get yourself trained first."
    52: "We want you to procure a small item for us..."
    53: "The Idol of Many Hands..."
    54: "...in the Governor's mansion!"
    55: "The Governor keeps the Idol o' Many Hands in a display case in the mansion outside of town."
    56: "You'll have to get past the guards, naturally."
    57: "The tricky part will be getting past the dogs outside."
    58: "They're a particularly vicious breed..."
