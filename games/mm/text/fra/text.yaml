    2: "Tu viens d'arriver dans le coin?"
    imguy: "Je m'appelle Guybrush Threepwood. Je viens d'arriver."
    rupirate: "Es-tu pirate? Puis-je me joindre à ton équipage?"
    charge: "Qui est-ce qui commande ici?"
    bye: "Enchanté d'avoir discuté avec toi."
    7: "Have fun on Mêlée Island™."
    8: "Hey, nice to see you again."
    9: "Guybrush Threepwood?"
    10: "Ha ha ha!!!"
    11: "C'est le nom le plus idiot que j'ai jamais entendu."
    ilikeguy: "Enfin... J'aime bien Guybrush."
    yourname: "Alors, comment t'appelles-TU?"
    dumb: "Ouais, c'est plutôt du genre stupide?"
    insulted: "Tu m'insultes. Au revoir."
    16: "Ce n'est même pas un nom!"
    17: "Je m'appelle Mancomb Seepgood."
    18: "Qu'est-ce qui t'amène donc sur l'Ile de Mêlée?"
    19: "Je veux devenir pirate!"
    20: "Je viens chercher l'aventure."
    21: "Je ne sais pas du tout."
    22: "Ce ne te regarde pas. Salut."
    23: "Ah, vraiment?"
    24: "Le conseil des pirates se trouve dans la pièce à côté."
    25: "C'est eux qui commandent ici."
    26: "They can tell you where to go and what to do."
    guvnor: "Où est-ce que je peux trouver le Gouverneur?"
    28: "Oh, you Have, have you?"
    29: "Well, I am a pirate."
    30: "But, alas, I'm not a captain."
    31: "Gouverneur Marley?"
    32: "Son palais est de l'autre côté de la ville."
    33: "Malheureusement les pirates n'y sont plus aussi bienvenus qu'avant."
    whynot: "Pourquoi?"
    welcome: "Où que j'aille, je suis le bienvenu."
    gothere: "Je vais y aller tout de suite. Salut."
    37: "Okay, but watch out for those guard dogs!"
    38: "My grog is going flat, so you'll have to excuse me."
    39: "I don't want to come between a pirate and his grog."
    40: "Well, this island has a governor..."
    41: "...but we pirates have our own leaders."
    leaders: "I want to talk to the leaders of the pirates."
    guvnor2: "Where can I find the Governor of the island?"

    46: "Mine is Mancomb Seepgood."
    47: "Sorry to see you go away mad."
    48: "Don't be a stranger."
    yourname2: "So, what was your name, anyway?"
    50: "Well, it sure wasn't for the sunshine."
    51: "I think you need some guidance."
    52: "La dernière fois qu'un pirate est allé manger chez elle, il est tombé amoureux."
    53: "It's made things rather uncomfortable for everybody."
    howsthat: "How's that?"
    whois: "Who is this pirate?"
    toobad: "That's too bad. Well, see you later."
    57: "Well, excuse me Mr. Secretive."
    58: "It was none other than the fearsome pirate LeChuck."
    59: "Well, there's a whole big story about what happened next..."
    60: "But I don't believe a word of it."
    61: "Estevan over there at the other table might tell you about it."
    62: "He takes the whole thing seriously."
    63: "Very seriously."
    64: "Whatever you say."
    65: "Just watch out for those guard dogs!"
    66: "Uh-oh, it looks like my grog is going flat, so you'll have to excuse me."
  citizen:
    1: "Excuse me, but do you have a cousin named Sven?"
    2: "What?"
    3: "No, I don't."
    4: "What is that? Some sort of code?"
    5: "No, but I once had a barber named Dominique."
    6: "Never mind."
    7: "Good night."
    8: "Excuse me, but do--"
    9: "Oh, it's only you again."
    10: "I just want a map."
    11: "My cousin Sven sends his regards."
    12: "Could you tell me that code again?"
    13: "Never mind. I can get a map somewhere else."
    14: "Wanna bet?"
    15: "Now get lost."
    16: "Of course it's a code, you idiot."
    17: "Close enough."
    18: "Let's talk business."
    19: "You want to buy a map to the Legendary Lost Treasure of Mêlée Island�?"
    20: "Only one in existence."
    21: "Rare."
    22: "Very rare."
    23: "Only 100 pieces of eight..."
    24: "No thanks. I don't have enough money."
    25: "No thanks. I don't want it."
    26: "Well then, buzz off kid, it's bad for business."
    27: "Come back for the map to the Legendary Lost Treasure of Mêlée Island�, eh?"
    28: "I hope you brought enough money this time."
    29: "Shhhhhhh!"
    30: "Pipe down, will ya?"
    31: "That ugly sheriff might be around here."
    32: "Now, then..."
    33: "I see."
    34: "Not enough money, eh?"
    35: "Come back when you're serious about treasure hunting, kid."
    36: "I'll take it. It'll make a swell gift."
    37: "There ya go. You've made a wise decision."
    38: "Now get lost."
  lowmoral:
    1: "Hey, nice rat!"
    2: "How can you stand to be near this vermin?"
    3: "Do you guys know the sneaky-looking man on the opposite corner?"
    4: "Say, are you guys pirates?"
    5: "I'll just be running along, now."
    6: "Do you like rats?"
    7: "Yes, I love rats!"
    8: "No, I can't stand them."
    9: "Yes, especially in a light wine sauce."
    10: "I can't talk about it right now. Got to go."
    11: "They're very intelligent creatures!"
    12: "Ha ha ha ha!!"
    13: "More intelligent than HIM!"
    14: "Why, there's a story around these parts that a bunch of rats actually crewed a ship here from fabled Monkey Island�."
    15: "No, that's not right."
    16: "It was actually a group of monkeys."
    17: "That's amazing!"
    18: "That's difficult to believe."
    19: "No way could a bunch of stupid monkeys crew a ship!"
    20: "Excuse me, I must be going."
    21: "But true."
    22: "When they arrived, they sold the ship for a pretty penny."
    23: "Only time I've seen anyone get the better of ol'Stan in a deal."
    24: "I thought it was rats..."
    25: "Wanna buy a map, eh?"
    26: "OUR maps are top quality, not like the birdcage liners you get from that clown across the street."
    27: "No, just kidding."
    28: "These are actually copies of the minutes of the last meeting of the M�l�e Island� PTA."
    29: "Can't even GIVE them away."
    30: "Want one?"
    31: "No, thanks."
    32: "No, I must be on my way."
    33: "No, but I'll take one if you give me two pieces of eight."
    34: "Oh, they are not so bad."
    35: "-- squeak --"
    36: "Sounds like this guy don't like rats!"
    37: "Let's sauté him now!"
    38: "I think you'd best leave, boy."
    39: "Ha ha ha ha ha hoo hoo ha ha ha"
    40: "I apologize for what I said about rats."
    41: "But it's true."
    42: "OK, that's fair."
    43: "No, we're a wandering circus troupe."
    44: "But this rat scared away the elephant."
    45: "Of course we're pirates!"
    46: "You can't buy clothes like these off the rack!"
    47: "What do you want?"
    48: "What's in the keg?"
    49: "Where'd you get that rat?"
    50: "Nothing. See you later."
    51: "How come you're on this street corner and not on a ship, looting, pillaging, sacking, that sort of thing?"
    52: "Rum."
    53: "Jam."
    54: "Er... rum and jam."
    55: "It's an old pirate favorite, everybody knows that."
    56: "Actually, they were chimps, and they WEREN'T stupid."
    57: "AIEEE!!! Get away!!!"
    58: "Well, pirating hasn't been panning out so well for us..."
    59: "There are some UNNATURALLY talented pirates in the area right now..."
    60: "...operating out of Monkey Island�."
    61: "So we've been pursuing alternate means of self-support."
    62: "We're trying to start up a circus."
    63: "It was working out well, until the rat scared off the elephant."
    64: "Now you've depressed us."
    65: "Go home."
    66: "See? Told you so."
    67: "I'll take those minutes if you give me two pieces of eight."
    68: "Do you know where I can find a treasure map around here?"
  lookout: 
    intro1: "I heard there was going to be a weenie roast here."
    intro2: "I'm looking for fun. Seen any?"
    intro3: "What's green and hairy and has a thousand legs?"
    intro4: "Do you ever wonder if we're all just characters in a novel?"
    5: "Yikes!"
    6: "You almost scared me to death."
    7: "I thought you were a--"
    8: "--never mind."
    9: "What did you say your name was, again?"
    imguy: "I'm Guybrush Threepwood."
    squinky: "Call me Squinky."
    overthisway: "I'm over this way."
    whoru: "Who are YOU?"
    fortune: "I'll just be off to seek my fortune now."
    15: "Eh?"
    16: "Oh."
    17: "I came to Mêlée Island because I want to be a pirate."
    18: "Well, you picked the right place for it."
    19: "Though perhaps the wrong time."
    20: "Not to mention the wrong name."
    21: "You have the silliest name I've heard in a long time."
    22: "What the heck is wrong with \"Guybrush Threepwood\"?"
    23: "Nothing, if you want to sell shoes."
    24: "You want to be a pirate, boy, take my advice:"
    25: "Change your name."
    26: "Try something like \"Dreadbeard\" or \"Six-fingered Pete\"."
    27: "You just said you were Gibberish Driftwood, or something like that."
    28: "GUYBRUSH THREEPwood."
    29: "Sure, whatever."
    30: "I'm the lookout of Mêlée Island."
    31: "I watch the ocean for approaching storms and ships, and report them directly to the Governor."
    32: "She doesn't like unexpected visitors."
    33: "...especially not now."
    whyguvworried: "Why is the Governor worried about unexpected visitors?"
    35: "Actually, it's the EXPECTED visitors we're worried about."
    36: "One pirate captain in particular..."
    37: "A dead one, but that doesn't make him any less dangerous."
    bat: "How did you get to be the lookout when you're obviously blind as a bat?"
    39: "Watch your tongue."
    40: "I was hand-picked by Sheriff Shinetop!"
    41: "OK, Squinky."
    42: "Good luck."
    43: "Oh, it's you again, "
    44: "Listen, I'm sort of busy right now."
    45: "I'll talk to you later."
    46: "Look out! Ha ha. Get it?"
    47: "That's THREEPWOOD."
    actuallyimguy: "Actually, my name is Guybrush Threepwood."
    49: "Oh, right."
    50: "I am not sure, but I think he may be asleep."
    51: "It's the only one I've ever heard that was more ridiculous than \"Squinky\"."
    overhere: "I'm over here."
    53: "Thranwook."
    54: "Thrumwink."

    5: "Décampe gamin, tu nous déranges."
    6: "Et alors?"
    7: "Pourquoi tu nous déranges avec ça?"
    8: "N'oubliez pas que nous manquons d'hommes à cause de cette histoire de LeChuck."
    9: "Et alors?"
    10: "C'est simple, sans pirate on a pas de butin, et sans butin pas de grog, et notre réserve diminue dangereusement."
    11: "Hum..."
    12: "Qu'est-ce que tu sais faire au juste?"
    13: "Je peux retenir mon souffle pendant dix minutes!"
    14: "Pas mal..."
    15: "Très bien, mais il ne suffit pas de DEMANDER pour devenir pirate."
    16: "Tu dois passer..."
    17: "Les trois épreuves!"
    18: "Ah..."
    19: "Quelles sont ces trois épreuves?"
    20: "Pour devenir pirate tu dois réussir les trois épreuves."

    22: "...et apprendre l'art du vol..."
    23: "...et de la chasse."
    24: "Ah oui?"
    25: "La chasse au trésor, espèce d'oursin!"
    26: "Ah d'accord."
    27: "Tu dois faire tes preuves dans chacune de ces disciplines."
    28: "l'escrime, le vol, et, hum, la chasse au trésor;"
    29: "et ramène une preuve à ton retour."
    30: "Et ensuite tu viens boire un grog avec nous!!"
    31: "GROG!!!"
    32: "Dites-moi comment maîtriser l'usage de l'épée."
    33: "Dites-moi comment apprendre l'art du vol."
    34: "Dites-moi comment faire la chasse au trésor."
    35: "Vous n'êtes que des buveurs de rhum à la mauvaise haleine!"
    36: "Au fait, qu'est-ce que vous mettez dans ce grog?"
    37: "Bon et bien je dois y aller maintenant."

    42: "Tout d'abord trouve une épée"
    43: "Ensuite va voir la Reine du Sabre pour la vaincre"
    44: "Quelqu'un en ville pourra sans doute t'indiquer le chemin à prendre"
    45: "Ah!"
    46: "D'abord tu dois trouver quelqu'un avec qui t'entraîner"
    47: "Ha ha."
    48: "Je t'imagine dé jà affronter la Reine du Sabre sans aucun entraînement!"
    49: "Ha Ha Ha"

  5: "They're busy listening to the guy on the left."
  6: "I don't think it's wise to wake a sleeping pirate."
  7: "Actually, I'm not THAT curious to find out what's inside."
  8: "Probably poisonous snakes."
  9: "No thanks, I'd rather not touch any of this creepy voodoo stuff."
  10: "Gee, I wonder what's in these baskets."
  11: "Hmmm... I think I hear slithering inside."
  12: "No thanks. Something would probably jump out and bite me."
  13: "Poor chickens..."
  14: "I'd better not. They're probably being saved for a pagan ritual, and I wouldn't want to spoil it."

  31: "Now, THIS is the cup of a carpenter."
  32: Hey!
  33: Don't go into the kitchen!
  34: You can't come back here!
  35: On dirait quelque chose qui ressemble à de la viande...
  36: Quelqu'un a cuisiné un fromage de tête à l'intérieur.
  37: Je crois que c'est un hareng.
  38: Je crois que cet oiseau va me picorer la main...
  39: Je crois qu'il est plein de cette boisson infâme que les pirates boivent.
  40: Elle boue.
  41: Miam miam. Un râgout.
  42: Aie.
  43: Je l'ai attrapé!
