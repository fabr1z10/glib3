# glib3

## Introduction

**glib3** is a 2D library to create old school games such as graphic adventures and platformers. The goal of this library is to make the process of writing a new game simple and intuitive. Key features are:

* The engine is an Entity component system. Each stage (or scene, or room) is a hierarchy of nodes (entities) with one or more components
* Game, stages and scripts are all described in LUA
* Complex behavior (such as AI) can be easily implemented by adding new c++ classes to the main library
